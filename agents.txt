# AI Agent Instructions for Trade Nexus

## Project Description
Trade Nexus is a web-based F&O P&L analytics dashboard. It parses Zerodha trading reports (Excel .xlsx files) and displays interactive charts and tables across 5 analytical tabs.

## For AI Agents
- This is a React + TypeScript frontend with a Python serverless backend
- The main API endpoint is POST /api/upload which accepts multipart form data
- All analytics are computed server-side in api/upload.py
- The frontend stores the full report JSON in React Context after upload
- No database is used — all data is ephemeral

## Key Context Files
- llm.md — Detailed technical context for LLMs
- README.md — Setup and usage instructions
- src/types/report.ts — TypeScript type definitions for all data structures
- api/upload.py — Complete backend logic

## Modification Guidelines
- Keep the dark theme consistent (see CSS variables in src/index.css)
- Currency formatting must use Indian notation (Lakhs/Crores)
- All new metrics should flow through: api/upload.py → types/report.ts → page component
- Charts use Recharts with dark tooltip styling from ChartWrapper.tsx
- Tables use TanStack Table v8 with DataTable.tsx wrapper

## Do Not
- Store uploaded files on the server
- Add authentication (this is a client-side tool)
- Change the Excel parsing logic without testing against Zerodha report format
